Cube
==========

Arduino project for translating a series States (vertices that exist for a set 
period of time) into corresponding LEDs in a 3D cube.


# Requirements
The project uses [Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) 
for the build system and [Standard C++ for Arduino](https://github.com/maniacbug/StandardCplusplus)
for some of the standard C++ libraries needed (e.g. std::vector)
